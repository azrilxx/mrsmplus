  "question": "Compare and contrast British colonial policies in Malaysia with those implemented in one other British colony. Discuss the similarities and differences in their approaches.",
  "answer": "British colonial policies in Malaysia shared similarities with other colonies such as India in implementing indirect rule through local rulers, establishing cash crop economies, and creating administrative divisions. However, Malaysia differed in having the unique Resident System where British advisors worked with Malay sultans, while India had more direct control through the Governor-General system. Both experienced economic exploitation but Malaysia focused more on tin and rubber while India emphasized cotton and spices. The racial categorization in Malaysia (Malay, Chinese, Indian) was more systematically implemented compared to the caste-based approach in India.",
