According to Newton's First Law, objects with greater mass have greater inertia and resist changes in motion more strongly. When braking, the same braking force applied to both trucks will produce less deceleration in the heavily loaded truck (F = ma, so a = F/m - larger mass means smaller acceleration). Additionally, the heavily loaded truck has more kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²), so more work must be done by the brakes to bring it to a stop, requiring either more force or more distance.",

During each bounce, some mechanical energy is converted to other forms: (1) Heat energy due to deformation of the ball and ground, (2) Sound energy from the impact, (3) Energy lost to air resistance.

    "answer": "This observation can be explained by understanding the relationship between wave properties and sound characteristics. When the guitar string is plucked harder, more energy is transferred to the string, causing it to vibrate with greater amplitude. Since loudness is directly proportional to amplitude, the sound becomes louder. However, the pitch depends on the frequency of vibration, which is determined by the string's length, tension, and mass per unit length. Plucking harder doesn't change these physical properties of the string, so the frequency remains constant, keeping the pitch the same. This demonstrates that amplitude (affecting loudness) and frequency (affecting pitch) are independent wave properties.",

In solids, particles are closely packed and strongly bonded, allowing vibrations to be transmitted quickly from one particle to the next. The strong intermolecular forces and high density create efficient energy transfer. In gases, particles are far apart with weak intermolecular forces, so vibrations take longer to propagate from particle to particle. Additionally, the elasticity of solids is much higher than gases, and sound speed is proportional to the square root of elasticity divided by density. Although solids are denser than gases, their much higher elasticity more than compensates for the density factor, resulting in faster sound transmission.",

    "answer": "Metals feel colder than wood at room temperature because metals are good conductors of heat while wood is a poor conductor (insulator). When you touch a metal object, it quickly conducts heat away from your warm hand, making your hand lose thermal energy rapidly. This rapid heat loss creates the sensation of coldness. Wood, being a poor conductor, does not conduct heat away from your hand as quickly, so it feels warmer. Both materials are actually at the same room temperature, but their different thermal conductivities create different sensations when touched.",

    "question": "Analyze why a thick blanket keeps you warm in cold weather, considering the principles of heat transfer.",
    "answer": "A thick blanket keeps you warm by reducing heat loss through all three methods of heat transfer. (1) Conduction: The blanket material (often containing air pockets) is a poor conductor, reducing direct heat transfer from your body to the cold environment. (2) Convection: The blanket traps a layer of warm air next to your body and prevents cold air circulation, minimizing convective heat loss. (3) Radiation: Some blanket materials can reflect radiated heat back to your body. The thickness creates more insulating material and trapped air, which is an excellent insulator. Your body continues to produce heat, and the blanket prevents this heat from escaping, maintaining a warm microenvironment around your body.",

    "question": "Analyze the thermal expansion of a steel bridge on a hot day and explain why expansion joints are necessary.",
    "answer": "On a hot day, a steel bridge undergoes thermal expansion because increased temperature causes the steel atoms to vibrate more vigorously, increasing the average distance between them and thus expanding the material. The expansion can be significant over the long span of a bridge (linear expansion = αLΔT, where α is the coefficient of expansion, L is original length, and ΔT is temperature change). Without expansion joints, this expansion would create enormous compressive stress in the bridge structure, potentially causing buckling, cracking, or structural failure. Expansion joints provide space for the bridge to expand and contract safely with temperature changes, preventing structural damage and maintaining the bridge's integrity across different seasons and weather conditions.",

It is represented by magnetic field lines that show the direction and strength of the magnetic force. Iron filings can be used to visualize magnetic fields by sprinkling them around a magnet on a sheet of paper. The iron filings align themselves along the magnetic field lines, revealing the pattern of the magnetic field. The filings cluster more densely where the field is stronger (near the poles) and spread out where the field is weaker.",

    "answer": "Household electrical appliances are connected in parallel rather than in series for several important reasons: (1) Independent operation - each appliance can be switched on or off independently without affecting others. In series, if one appliance stops working, all others would stop too. (2) Constant voltage - in parallel connection, each appliance receives the full mains voltage (240V in Malaysia), ensuring optimal performance. In series, voltage would be divided among appliances. (3) Individual control - each appliance can have its own switch and operate at its designed power rating. (4) Practical current requirements - different appliances require different currents, which is easily accommodated in parallel connection but problematic in series where the same current flows through all devices.",

    "answer": "Electromagnets are preferred over permanent magnets in industrial applications like scrap metal cranes because they offer controllability and versatility that permanent magnets cannot provide. Key advantages include: (1) Control - electromagnets can be switched on and off by controlling the electric current, allowing precise timing for picking up and releasing materials. (2) Variable strength - the magnetic field strength can be adjusted by changing the current, accommodating different weights and materials. (3) Safety - materials can be safely released by simply turning off the current, preventing accidents that could occur if trying to remove materials from permanent magnets. (4) Selectivity - electromagnets can be designed to work optimally with specific types of ferromagnetic materials. (5) Maintenance - if an electromagnet fails, it can often be repaired by replacing electrical components, while permanent magnets may lose their magnetism permanently and need complete replacement.",
