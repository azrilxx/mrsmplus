    "question": "What is the difference between ionic and covalent bonds?",
    "answer": "Ionic bonds form between metals and non-metals through transfer of electrons, creating charged ions that attract each other. Example: NaCl (sodium chloride). Properties: high melting points, conduct electricity when dissolved, often soluble in water. Covalent bonds form between non-metals through sharing of electrons. Example: H₂O (water). Properties: lower melting points, generally don't conduct electricity, variable solubility. Ionic compounds form crystal lattices, while covalent compounds form discrete molecules.",

    "answer": "Given: 2x² + 5x - 3 = 0, so a = 2, b = 5, c = -3. Using quadratic formula: x = (-5 ± √(5² - 4(2)(-3))) / (2(2)) = (-5 ± √(25 + 24)) / 4 = (-5 ± √49) / 4 = (-5 ± 7) / 4. Therefore: x₁ = (-5 + 7)/4 = 1/2 and x₂ = (-5 - 7)/4 = -3. The solutions are x = 1/2 and x = -3.",

    "answer": "The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a). It is used to solve quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0 when factoring is difficult or impossible. The discriminant (b² - 4ac) determines the nature of solutions: if positive, two real solutions; if zero, one real solution; if negative, two complex solutions.",

    "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The overall chemical equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. This process occurs in chloroplasts and involves two main stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).",
