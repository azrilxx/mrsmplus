    "question": "Explain the greenhouse effect and its impact on global warming.",
    "answer": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, keeping the planet warm enough to support life. However, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O) from human activities enhance this effect, leading to global warming. This results in climate change, rising sea levels, melting ice caps, and extreme weather patterns. The enhanced greenhouse effect disrupts natural climate balance and threatens ecosystems worldwide.",

    "answer": "Given: Voltage (V) = 12 V, Current (I) = 3 A. Using Ohm's Law: V = IR. Rearranging: R = V/I = 12/3 = 4 Ω. Therefore, the resistance of the wire is 4 ohms.",

    "question": "Analyze why copper is preferred over aluminum for household electrical wiring.",
    "answer": "Copper is preferred over aluminum for household electrical wiring for several reasons: (1) Lower electrical resistance - copper has better conductivity, reducing energy loss and heat generation. (2) Mechanical strength - copper is more durable and less likely to break during installation. (3) Corrosion resistance - copper resists oxidation better than aluminum. (4) Safety - copper connections are more stable and less prone to loosening, reducing fire hazards. (5) Compatibility - copper works better with existing electrical components and connectors.",
