    "question": "Explain the concept of natural selection in evolution.",
    "answer": "Natural selection is the mechanism by which organisms with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing these traits to offspring. The process involves: (1) Variation - individuals in a population have different traits, (2) Inheritance - traits are passed from parents to offspring, (3) Selection - environmental pressures favor certain traits, (4) Time - over many generations, beneficial traits become more common. This leads to adaptation and evolution of species.",

    "question": "Describe the structure and function of mitochondria in cell biology.",
    "answer": "Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles known as the powerhouse of the cell. Structure: They have an outer membrane and an inner membrane with cristae (folds) that increase surface area. The space inside is called the matrix. Function: Mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration, specifically oxidative phosphorylation. They contain their own DNA and ribosomes, suggesting they evolved from ancient bacteria. They also play roles in calcium storage and apoptosis (programmed cell death).",
