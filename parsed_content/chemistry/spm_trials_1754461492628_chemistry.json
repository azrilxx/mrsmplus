    "question": "Calculate the area of a triangle with sides 5 cm, 12 cm, and 13 cm.",
    "answer": "First, check if it's a right triangle: 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13². Yes, it's a right triangle with legs 5 cm and 12 cm, and hypotenuse 13 cm. Area of right triangle = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 5 × 12 = 30 cm². Therefore, the area is 30 square centimeters.",
