    "question": "Define photosynthesis and state its overall chemical equation.",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose. The overall chemical equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. This process occurs in chloroplasts and involves two main stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).",
