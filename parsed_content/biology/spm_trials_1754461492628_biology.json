    "question": "Describe the structure and function of mitochondria in cell biology.",
    "answer": "Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles known as the powerhouse of the cell. Structure: They have an outer membrane and an inner membrane with cristae (folds) that increase surface area. The space inside is called the matrix. Function: Mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration, specifically oxidative phosphorylation. They contain their own DNA and ribosomes, suggesting they evolved from ancient bacteria. They also play roles in calcium storage and apoptosis (programmed cell death).",
