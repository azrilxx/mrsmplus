    "question": "Explain the concept of natural selection in evolution.",
    "answer": "Natural selection is the mechanism by which organisms with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing these traits to offspring. The process involves: (1) Variation - individuals in a population have different traits, (2) Inheritance - traits are passed from parents to offspring, (3) Selection - environmental pressures favor certain traits, (4) Time - over many generations, beneficial traits become more common. This leads to adaptation and evolution of species.",
