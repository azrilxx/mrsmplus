    "answer": "Using Pythagoras' theorem: c² = a² + b², where c is the hypotenuse. c² = 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore c = √25 = 5 cm. The hypotenuse is 5 cm long. This forms a 3-4-5 right-angled triangle, which is a common Pythagorean triple.",

    "answer": "Area = length × width, so 24 = 8 × width. Therefore width = 24 ÷ 8 = 3 cm. Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(8 + 3) = 2(11) = 22 cm. The width is 3 cm and the perimeter is 22 cm.",
