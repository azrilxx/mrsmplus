    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the primary gas required for cellular respiration?",
      "choices": ["Carbon dioxide", "Oxygen", "Nitrogen", "Hydrogen"],
      "answer": "Oxygen",
      "explanation": "Oxygen is required for cellular respiration to break down glucose and produce energy.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "topic": "Cellular Respiration"
    },
    {
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Explain the difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.",
      "answer": "Aerobic respiration requires oxygen and produces more ATP (38 molecules), while anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen and produces less ATP (2 molecules).",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Plants only carry out photosynthesis and do not respire.",
      "choices": ["True", "False"],
      "answer": "False",
      "explanation": "Plants perform both photosynthesis and cellular respiration. They respire continuously but photosynthesize only in the presence of light.",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    },
    {
      "type": "fill-blank",
      "question": "The process of respiration occurs in the _______ of the cell.",
      "answer": "mitochondria",
      "explanation": "Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell where cellular respiration takes place.",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following is a product of cellular respiration?",
      "choices": ["Glucose", "Oxygen", "Carbon dioxide", "Sunlight"],
      "answer": "Carbon dioxide",
      "explanation": "Cellular respiration produces carbon dioxide, water, and ATP as end products.",
      "difficulty": "easy"
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What type of nutrition do green plants exhibit?",
      "choices": ["Heterotrophic", "Autotrophic", "Parasitic", "Saprophytic"],
      "answer": "Autotrophic",
      "explanation": "Green plants are autotrophic as they make their own food through photosynthesis.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "topic": "Plant Nutrition"
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which enzyme breaks down proteins?",
      "choices": ["Amylase", "Lipase", "Pepsin", "Catalase"],
      "answer": "Pepsin",
      "explanation": "Pepsin is a protease enzyme that breaks down proteins in the stomach.",
