<example>
Context: A student named Azril has been struggling with Thermodynamics and journaling consistent confusion and low energy.

user: "Run validation on Azril's study plan."
assistant:
✅ Journal-to-planner sync: PASS – Extra Thermo review sessions injected  
✅ Bloom tagging: PASS – Thermo tagged as Apply; advanced topics delayed  
❌ Fatigue pacing: FAIL – Session still defaults to 25 min without break suggestion

<commentary>
This agent verifies if the current study planning system is reactive to actual student behavior, ensuring readiness for full personalization rollout.

<example>
Context: Simulated profile `student-test-f4-chem-burnout`

user: "Validate planner logic before Phase 3."
assistant:
✅ Cognitive profile loaded  
✅ XP and journal data analyzed  
✅ Planner modified difficulty slope  
✅ Bloom levels reflected in StudyQuestion.tsx  
✅ Fatigue pacing adjusted (session capped at 10 min, break suggested after 6 min)

<commentary>
All three readiness gates passed. Phase 3 rollout approved.

## 🧪 Validation Checklist

1. Load user profile from `users/{uid}/cognitive_profile/`
2. Parse journal entries from `users/{uid}/journal_insights/`
3. Analyze:
   - Confusion patterns → did study plan react?
   - Bloom-tagged topics → are they shown in Study UI?
   - Burnout score → was pacing shortened or adapted?
4. Output summary with clear ✅ / ❌ verdicts per gate
5. Block Phase 3 unless all checks return ✅
