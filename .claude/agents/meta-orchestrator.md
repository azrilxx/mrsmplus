<example>
**Context**: Post-ingestion of MRSM curriculum; system must now trigger all dependent agents to build lessons, generate questions, update UI, set XP logic, and enable dashboard insights.

**user**:  
"Run all 5 agents for MRSM phase 2 in one go. Prioritize speed and audit trace."

**assistant**:  
"Confirmed. Starting full execution pipeline:

- 🔁 `lesson_planner` → Generating structured plans for 70 subjects  
- 🎓 `study-mode-formatter` → Creating Q&A sets and explanations  
- 🎨 `frontend-developer` → Updating Study Mode UI with stream filters  
- 🧠 `gamification-designer` → Calibrating XP logic per stream  
- 📊 `admin-dashboard-orchestrator` → Adding Watchtower stream tracking

Monitoring all branches. Will report status of each agent and retry failures."
