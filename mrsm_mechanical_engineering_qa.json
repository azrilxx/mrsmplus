    "question": "State Newton's First Law of Motion and explain how it applies to a stationary crane holding a heavy load.",
    "answer": "Newton's First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. For a stationary crane holding a heavy load, the load remains at rest because the upward force from the crane cable exactly balances the downward gravitational force. The net force is zero, so there is no acceleration - demonstrating the law of inertia.",

    "answer": "Using force equilibrium: ΣFx = 0 and ΣFy = 0. Let T1 be tension at 30° and T2 at 45°. Horizontal: T1cos30° = T2cos45°, so T1(0.866) = T2(0.707). Vertical: T1sin30° + T2sin45° = 500N, so T1(0.5) + T2(0.707) = 500. Solving simultaneously: T1 = 366N and T2 = 448N. This demonstrates vector resolution in static equilibrium problems common in structural engineering.",

    "answer": "Static equilibrium occurs when forces and moments are balanced and the object remains at rest, like a completed building structure or a stationary tower crane. Dynamic equilibrium occurs when forces are balanced but the object moves at constant velocity, like a construction elevator moving up at steady speed or a concrete mixer truck traveling at constant speed on PLUS highway. Both require net force = 0, but static has zero velocity while dynamic has constant non-zero velocity.",

    "question": "What is the resultant force when three forces act on a point: 100N east, 80N north, and 60N at 30° south of west?",
    "answer": "Using component method: Force 1: Fx1 = 100N, Fy1 = 0. Force 2: Fx2 = 0, Fy2 = 80N. Force 3: Fx3 = -60cos30° = -52N, Fy3 = -60sin30° = -30N. Sum: ΣFx = 100 + 0 + (-52) = 48N. ΣFy = 0 + 80 + (-30) = 50N. Resultant magnitude: R = √(48² + 50²) = 69.3N. Direction: θ = tan⁻¹(50/48) = 46.2° north of east.

    "question": "Define torque and explain its relationship to force and moment arm.",
    "answer": "Torque (or moment) is the rotational effect of a force about a pivot point, measured as the product of force magnitude and perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action. Formula: T = F × r × sinθ, where F is force, r is distance from pivot, and θ is angle between force and radius vector. Maximum torque occurs when force is perpendicular to the moment arm (θ = 90°). Units are Newton-meters (N⋅m). This principle is crucial in designing wrenches, motors, and rotating machinery.",

    "answer": "For perpendicular force: T = F × r = 80N × 0.40m = 32 N⋅m. For 60° angle: T = F × r × sin60° = 80N × 0.40m × 0.866 = 27.7 N⋅m. The angled force produces less torque because only the perpendicular component contributes to rotation. This explains why mechanics apply force perpendicular to wrench handles for maximum effectiveness, and why longer wrenches provide mechanical advantage in automotive repair work.",

For a seesaw with weights W1 and W2 at distances d1 and d2 from the fulcrum: W1 × d1 = W2 × d2. If a 600N child sits 2m from the fulcrum, a 400N child must sit at distance d2 = (600N × 2m)/400N = 3m from the fulcrum on the opposite side. This principle applies to crane counterweights and beam design in construction.",

    "question": "Analyze why a longer wrench provides greater mechanical advantage when loosening tight bolts in automotive maintenance.",
    "answer": "A longer wrench increases the moment arm (perpendicular distance from pivot to force application point), resulting in greater torque for the same applied force (T = F × r). If doubling the wrench length from 20cm to 40cm, the same 100N force produces torque of 20 N⋅m versus 40 N⋅m respectively. This mechanical advantage allows technicians to overcome high resistance with less muscular effort. However, longer wrenches require more space and may flex under high loads, so optimal length depends on bolt torque requirements and workspace constraints.",

This means materials deform linearly under load and return to original shape when load is removed. For construction materials like steel (E ≈ 200 GPa) and concrete (E ≈ 30 GPa), this relationship helps engineers predict deformation under service loads.

However, actual performance is lower due to: motor efficiency (typically 80-95%), friction in pulley systems, acceleration requirements, and safety factors. Real lifting speed might be 0.6-0.8 m/s.

    "answer": "For a pulley system, mechanical advantage (MA) equals the number of supporting ropes: MA = 4. Required effort force = Load/MA = 1000N/4 = 250N. The system trades distance for force - while you pull 4 times the distance, you only need ¼ of the load weight as effort. If the load rises 1m, you must pull 4m of rope.
