## üîç Bottleneck Report

### Critical Performance Issues

1. **XP Badge Animation Blocking (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Location: `components/XPBadge.tsx:26-31`
   - Issue: 2-second animation timeout delays user reward feedback
   - Impact: Reduces motivation and perceived responsiveness
   - Students expect instant gratification for XP rewards

2. **Home Page Cold Start (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Location: `pages/index.tsx:49-71`
   - Issues:
     - Multiple synchronous localStorage reads
     - Heavy subject card rendering (5 cards with progress calculations)
     - Real-time greeting calculation on every render
   - Impact: Poor first impression, especially on 3G connections

3. **Planner Drag Performance (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
   - Location: `pages/planner.tsx:140-155` & `components/PlannerStep.tsx:91-100`
   - Issues:
     - State updates on every drag event
     - Complex CSS transforms during drag
     - Multiple re-renders of task list
   - Impact: Janky drag experience reduces planning engagement

4. **Typewriter Effect Optimization (LOW PRIORITY)**
   - Location: `components/AnswerCard.tsx:44-53`
   - Issues:
     - Fixed 30ms interval regardless of text length
     - No batching for long answers
     - Cannot be interrupted efficiently
   - Impact: May feel slow for short answers, blocks user interaction

### Network & Firebase Concerns

5. **Firebase Mock Implementation**
   - All Firebase operations currently return mock data
   - Real performance under 3G conditions unknown
   - Risk: Production performance may be significantly worse

6. **Asset Loading**
   - No lazy loading for components
   - CSS animations loaded upfront
   - Large React bundle size for MVP

## üìã Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Sprint 1)

1. **Reduce XP Animation Duration**
   ```typescript
   // components/XPBadge.tsx:26-31
   const timer = setTimeout(() => {
     setIsAnimating(false);
     setShowGain(false);
   }, 500); // Change from 2000ms to 500ms
   ```

2. **Optimize Home Page Loading**
   ```typescript
   // pages/index.tsx:49-71
   // Move localStorage reads to useCallback
   // Cache greeting calculation
   // Implement progressive loading for subject cards
   ```

3. **Debounce Drag Operations**
   ```typescript
   // components/PlannerStep.tsx:91-100
   // Use requestAnimationFrame for drag updates
   // Batch state updates during drag sequences
   ```

### Medium-term Improvements (Sprint 2)

4. **Implement Lazy Loading**
   - Use React.lazy() for heavy components
   - Progressive subject card rendering
   - Virtualize long task lists in planner

5. **Optimize Animations for Low-end Devices**
   ```css
   /* styles/animations.css:204-212 */
   /* Add more aggressive mobile optimizations */
   @media (max-width: 480px) and (max-device-memory: 2) {
     .animate-float { animation: none; }
     .animate-bounce-in { animation-duration: 0.2s; }
   }
   ```

6. **Firebase Performance Optimization**
   - Implement connection caching
   - Use Firestore offline persistence
   - Batch read/write operations
   - Add network state detection

### Long-term Enhancements

7. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add Web Vitals tracking
   - Implement React Profiler
   - Monitor real user metrics (RUM)

8. **Cultural Performance Considerations**
   - Reduce animation intensity for battery-conscious users
   - Support for slower device refresh rates
   - Implement "lite mode" for very low-end devices

## üìä Simulated 3G Performance Estimates

Based on code analysis and mobile testing patterns:

- **Initial Page Load**: 4-6 seconds
- **XP Animation**: 2+ seconds (current) ‚Üí 0.5 seconds (optimized)
- **Question Submission**: 2-3 seconds + network latency
- **Planner Drag Response**: 100-200ms (current) ‚Üí 16-33ms (optimized)

## üéØ Priority Implementation Order

1. **Week 1**: Fix XP animation duration (1-line change)
2. **Week 1**: Optimize home page localStorage reads
3. **Week 2**: Implement drag performance improvements
4. **Week 2**: Add typewriter skip/speed controls
5. **Week 3**: Implement lazy loading for components
6. **Week 4**: Add real Firebase performance testing

## üîß Development Environment Setup

For accurate performance testing:

```bash
# Install Chrome DevTools Performance extensions
npm install --save-dev web-vitals
npm install --save-dev @types/react-dom

# Enable React Profiler in development
# Add to components requiring performance monitoring
```

## üåê Cultural & Accessibility Notes

- Islamic geometric patterns in celebrations should use CSS transforms instead of multiple DOM elements
- Malay/English text switching should not trigger layout shifts
- Animation preferences must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Consider Ramadan battery-saving mode (reduced animations)
