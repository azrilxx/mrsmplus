# MARA+ MVP Scope Definition

## âœ… In-Scope for MVP (Sprints 1 & 2)

### Core Engine (Sprint 1)
- **AI Q&A engine** - Primary value proposition for instant academic help
- **XP system** - Basic gamification to drive engagement without complexity
- **Mobile UI** - Essential for MRSM students' primary device usage
- **Auth** - Required for personalization and progress tracking
- **Firebase DB** - Scalable backend foundation

### Essential Features (Sprint 2)
- **Study Pathway Planner** - Core academic guidance aligned with MRSM curriculum
- **Subject detection** - Smart content categorization for Malaysian syllabus
- **Simple dashboard** - Clean progress view without overwhelming new users
- **Streak XP** - Proven engagement mechanic that's easy to understand

## ðŸ’¤ Deferred to v2 (Optional / Post-MVP)

### Advanced Personalization
- **Mood analyzer** - Adds complexity; focus on core academic value first
- **Adaptive scheduling** - Requires behavioral data collection period
- **Reflection journal** - Nice-to-have but not essential for Form 1 adoption

### Social Features
- **Leaderboard** - Can create pressure; test core features first
- **Badges** - Additional gamification layer after core XP proves effective

### Analytics & Monitoring
- **Parent dashboard** - Important but requires separate user onboarding flow
- **Advanced analytics** - Valuable for Form 5 but overwhelming for younger students

### Technical Enhancements
- **Modular onboarding** - Over-engineering; simple linear flow sufficient initially
- **Daily missions** - Feature creep; XP and streaks provide sufficient motivation

## ðŸš« Not Recommended

### Complex Infrastructure
- **Offline mode** - While important for rural students, adds significant technical complexity that could delay MVP launch. Recommend mobile-first responsive design instead that works on slower connections.

### Scope Rationale

**For Form 1 Students**: Simplified feature set prevents cognitive overload during crucial adaptation period to secondary school.

**For Form 5 Students**: Core academic tools (Q&A, pathways) provide immediate SPM preparation value without feature distraction.

**Launch Strategy**: Validate core value proposition first, then iterate based on actual usage patterns rather than assumed needs.

*This scope prioritizes proven engagement mechanics (XP, streaks) with core academic value (Q&A, pathways) while deferring features that could delay launch or overwhelm early adopters.*
