## âœ¨ Whimsy Design Guidelines

### Delightful Micro-Interactions
- **Purposeful Animation**: Every animation serves to provide feedback, guide attention, or celebrate achievement
- **Performance-Conscious**: All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and device battery levels
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Geometric patterns inspired by Islamic art for celebration effects, avoiding imagery that may conflict with cultural values
- **Educational Context**: Whimsy elements reinforce learning goals rather than distract from them

### Age-Appropriate Gamification
- **Form 1-2**: More playful animations, encouraging sounds, simplified celebrations
- **Form 3-4**: Balanced approach with moderate animations and achievement feedback
- **Form 5**: Subtle, mature interactions focused on progress visualization and motivation

### Encouraging Language Patterns
- **Bilingual Support**: Motivational phrases rotate between Bahasa Malaysia and English
- **Achievement Messages**: "Syabas!", "Hebat!", "Well done!", "Keep going!", "Almost there!"
- **Cultural Greetings**: Time-based greetings that respect daily prayer schedules
- **Growth Mindset**: Language emphasizes effort and improvement over absolute performance

### Sound Design (Optional)
- **Respectful Audio**: All sounds respect device silence settings and Islamic principles
- **Achievement Sounds**: Gentle chimes and positive audio cues for completions
- **Feedback Tones**: Subtle audio confirmation for interactions when appropriate
- **Cultural Considerations**: No music, focus on natural sounds and notification chimes

## ðŸŽ¯ Design Constraints

### Accessibility & Usability
- **One-handed use**: All primary actions within thumb reach (bottom 2/3 of screen)
- **Large tap targets**: Minimum 44px for rural students with varying device familiarity
- **High contrast**: Ensure readability in bright outdoor conditions common in rural areas
- **Clear hierarchy**: Bold headings, consistent spacing, obvious primary actions

### Performance & Connectivity
- **Offline-lite support**: Essential content cached locally, graceful degradation for slow connections
- **Data efficiency**: Prioritize text over images, compress assets, lazy-load non-critical content
- **3G optimization**: Page loads under 3 seconds on slower rural connections
- **Progressive loading**: Critical content first, enhancements layer in

### Technical Requirements
- **Local font fallback**: System fonts when custom fonts fail to load
- **No asset bloat**: SVG icons, minimal external dependencies
- **Touch-first interactions**: Swipe, tap, long-press patterns over hover states
- **Battery awareness**: Minimize animations on low-battery devices

### Form-Specific Adaptations
- **Form 1-2**: Simplified navigation, larger buttons, guided workflows
- **Form 3-4**: Balanced complexity, more subject options, moderate customization
- **Form 5**: Advanced features, SPM focus, full planner control, detailed analytics

### Cultural Considerations
- **MRSM branding**: Official colors and iconography where appropriate
- **Bilingual ready**: Component structure supports BM/English toggle with smooth language transition animations
- **Islamic calendar**: Hijri date support for relevant cultural context
- **Modest design**: Clean, professional aesthetic appropriate for Islamic education environment
- **Whimsy Integration**: Celebration patterns use geometric Islamic art motifs, time-based greetings respect prayer schedules, encouraging phrases blend BM/English naturally
