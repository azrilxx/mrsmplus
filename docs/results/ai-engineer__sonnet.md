This is the AI engineer agent configuration file for the MARA+ educational platform. It defines:

- **Model**: sonnet
- **Purpose**: Operational Claude sub-agent for executing engineering tasks autonomously
- **Tools**: write and read capabilities
- **Output Format**: Structured JSON responses with agent name, status, and output
- **Example**: Shows it can propose fallback strategies for Claude agent execution

The file appears to be a legitimate configuration for an educational platform's AI agent system.
