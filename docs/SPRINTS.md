## ðŸ“Œ Design Notes

### Why This Order Matters
1. **Sprint 1** addresses the critical "immediate value" problem - students see benefit within seconds
2. **Sprint 2** unlocks the core promise - personalized learning without overwhelming features
3. **Sprint 3** adds intelligence without complexity - mood/reflection are optional enhancements
4. **Sprint 4** tackles retention through social proof once core habits are established

### Agent Responsibility Matrix

| Sprint | Primary Agents | Supporting Agents |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `quizmaster-agent`, `xp_sync_agent`, `frontend-developer` | `firebase_connector`, `ui-designer` |
| 2 | `study-pathway-planner`, `lesson_planner`, `data_ingestor` | `performance-benchmarker`, `frontend-designer` |
| 3 | `mood_analyzer`, `study_reflection`, `daily_missions_engine` | `ai-engineer`, `whimsy-injector` |
| 4 | `leaderboard_engine`, `achievement_system`, `parent_module` | `offline-mode-engineer`, `teacher-integrations-agent` |

### UX Checkpoint Strategy
- **Post-Sprint 1**: Mobile usability testing with Form 1 students
- **Post-Sprint 2**: Subject engagement analysis across Form 1-3
- **Post-Sprint 3**: Mood/reflection adoption rates
- **Post-Sprint 4**: Retention and parent satisfaction metrics

### Risk Mitigation
- **Feature Overload**: Each sprint is independently valuable
- **Mobile Performance**: Mobile-first design enforced from Sprint 1
- **Rural Connectivity**: Offline mode prioritized in Sprint 4
- **Language Barriers**: Simplified UI text, tested with Form 1 students

### Technical Checkpoints
- **Sprint 1**: Firebase performance under load
- **Sprint 2**: Algorithm accuracy for weakness detection
- **Sprint 3**: Mood data privacy compliance
- **Sprint 4**: Parent dashboard security audit
